# Netcutter4linux
Bash Script which is similar to tuxcut and netcut. It uses some dependenies like netdiscover, arping to cut the net of the victim.
Since I couldn't found any tool which cuts the net using arp other than arp-spoofing attacks I created a diffrent netcutting script which uses gratuitous arp.
